   <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hey, my name is Jerry Bonne-Annee. I am a student here at the University of Rhode Island. 
      I am currently a math major and hopefully graduate with a B.S in Applied Mathematics by May 2020. 
    I am apart of TD Nation and a brother in the organization called B.O.N.D(Brothers On a New Direction) 
      on campus.<br>I like playing basketball on my spare time. I'm very competitive, especially if it involves
    anything with a ball. My favorite basketball player is Kevin Durant!</p>
